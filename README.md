## Overview

YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. This project adapts YOLO for applications related to carbon footprint analysis, enabling the detection of objects that contribute to carbon emissions in various environments.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using YOLOv3.
- Support for image and video inputs.
- Customizable detection classes relevant to carbon footprint analysis.
- Easy integration with other systems for further analysis.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip package manager

### Clone the Repository


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Carbon-Footpring-Analyser/Yolo_Implementation.git
cd Yolo_Implementation
```


### Install Dependencies


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

### Download Pre-trained Weights

Download the YOLOv3 pre-trained weights and place them in the appropriate directory:


```bash
wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
```


### Run Detection on Images


```bash
python detect.py --image /path/to/image.jpg
```


### Run Detection on Videos


```bash
python detect.py --video /path/to/video.mp4
```


## Results

Sample detections are stored in the `output/` directory.
